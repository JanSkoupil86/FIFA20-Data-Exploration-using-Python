To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Install the required Python modules mentioned in the Prerequisites section.
3. Run the Python script "fifa_analysis.py" to perform the data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis tasks on the FIFA 20 dataset.

## Contents

The repository contains the following files:

- `fifa_analysis.py`: The main Python script that performs the data analysis tasks.
- `players_20.csv`: The FIFA 20 dataset in CSV format.
- `README.md`: This README file providing information about the repository.

## Tasks Performed

The Python script in this repository performs the following tasks on the FIFA 20 dataset:

1. Importing the required modules.
2. Loading the FIFA 20 dataset.
3. Data preprocessing, including dropping useless columns, calculating BMI, converting player positions, filling missing values, etc.
4. Exploratory data analysis, including scatter plots, pie charts, histograms, and scatterpolar plots.
5. Picking top players based on player position and value in Euros.

## Results

The analysis of the FIFA 20 dataset provides insights into various aspects of the player data, including overall ratings, player values, player positions, growth over time, and more. The results are visualized using different types of plots, such as scatter plots, pie charts, histograms, and scatterpolar plots.
